# TODO-LIST
Here is a todo list using JavaScript ( mostly) named "Vanilla". It uses internal storage to save the lists. You might also import and export these lists as also edit, delete and mark the tasks in each list you've created. There are shortcuts too, press "T" key to change the theme and "N" for new list (not in typing mode)
